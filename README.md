# A-comparative-study-of-credit-risk-model-for-P2P-lending
The aim of the thesis is to study the credit rating system used in P2P lending platforms like Zopa. This study specifically investigates the factors which makes a loan to be successful or default. It examines the critical factors in assessing credit quality and probability of default from the perspective of the investor. 

This study will explore the datasets of two large peer to peer platforms, namely Zopa and RateSetter. This study shows a correlation matrix to see which factors play an important role in determining the nature of the loan. A logistic regression model is used to see the variables which effect the status of the loan and by how much. It will take a dynamic review of the current developments of P2P lending based on previous literature.
